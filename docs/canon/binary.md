# The isekai binary — the law as a harness

`isekai` is a single Go binary that runs an agent session on a world. The convention was written
for harnesses that only *read* it (Claude Code, OpenCode); a model can read a law and still skip
it. Here the law is the harness: the gate, Vitality, the log, the human gate, the instruments and
the wire are code paths the model cannot route around, and every creature is a native type.

Source: `isekai/` at the repository root (Go module; stdlib plus the Charm libraries for the
terminal UI, `canon/tui.md`). Build with
`go build -o bin/isekai ./cmd/isekai` from `isekai/`. Toolchain: Go ≥ 1.23.

## Principles of the build

- **Minimal.** Standard library only — except the terminal UI, built on the Charm libraries
  (`canon/tui.md`). No LSP, no plugin system. A feature enters when a session names the need twice
  (Nature 4).
- **Files are truth.** The binary reads and writes the same files the JS instruments do
  (`log.md`, `memory/`, `toolbox/`, `instruments/`) in the same formats. It never keeps a private
  store the world cannot read without it.
- **The law is enforced, not recited.** Every rule the binary can check, it checks in code; what
  it cannot check it puts in front of the model at the moment it applies, not once at start.
- **Containment by construction.** Nothing reaches outside the world except the model provider
  call itself and actions that passed the human gate.

## Packages

| Package | Holds | Law it carries |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | one `Provider` interface (messages + tool calls + usage); `anthropic` (Messages API), `openai` (chat-completions — also OpenRouter, Ollama, any compatible endpoint), `mock` (scripted, for tests) | the provider call is the one standing outward act |
| `tool` | `Tool{Name, Description, Schema, Class, Run}`; built-ins `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `glob`, `grep`, `dispatch` | every tool declares a class; `bash` is classified per command (port of `loop.js`'s classifier) — a declared class only tightens |
| `gate` | the human gate: the TUI's choice block or the TTY prompt (`Gate.Answer` is the seam), `--approve <class>` pre-approval, `--dry-run` | Nature 7, Law 6: outward and destructive always ask; nothing auto-approved; a denial stops the turn |
| `loop` | the turn engine: perceive → recall → plan → act → verify → record per tool step; journal to `.isekai/instruments/loop/<run-id>.jsonl` | §The loop — budgets are readings; past one, checkpoint and stop honestly |
| `instrument` | context occupancy from provider-reported usage, 200k budget / 180k stress zone; `status` board | Nature 9, §Instruments — Rimuru's stress is a reading |
| `memory` | port of `memory.js`: status, index, recall (meaning + relation rank), remember (`--kind law|colony|territory`) | §Memory tiers — same files, same formats |
| `toolbox` | port of `toolbox.js`: registry build, `brief` (level-1 `@T` manifest under a budget), `load` (level 2, journaled) | §Minds & Bodies — the toolbox |
| `wire` | parse and emit the envelope (`@S @F @V @? @U @E`, `@ROOT @SCOPE @ASK @CAP @DUMP`); `@CAP` enforced | Absolute Rule II, Nature 8 |
| `world` | world discovery, the law loader (crest always; code sections on demand), ranks and bodies from `.isekai/{elf,orc,slime}/`, `log.md` append-only writer, the Orc gate and the Vitality check, Court dispatch | Natures 1–4, the gate, Laws 2–4 |
| `onto` | the ontology: schema, graph, reasoning, validation, projection | §The ontology below |
| `config` | the switchboard (`canon/config.md`): layers, origins, refusals, permission rules, models per office/rank/task, ranks as data | the honesty rule; a disabled law is a finding |
| `compact` | the drain: pointerize, trim, the unsaid, the desk, the episode, verify | §Compaction below |
| `sandbox` · `shell` | bwrap containment and env scrubbing; one persistent bash per body with background jobs | Nature 7, §Bash below |
| `mcp` · `discover` | the MCP client (stdio, streamable HTTP); what other harnesses wrote (instructions, Minds, commands, Bodies, MCP imports) | §MCP below; `harness-parity.md` |
| `board` | the world, seen: an HTTP handler over the same instruments | §The board below |
| `app` | the one engine behind both binaries: config → world → providers, shelf, MCP, discoveries, hooks; sessions (JSONL), the live session (the TUI on a terminal, the line REPL on a pipe or `--plain`), `run`, `bench`, `selftest`, `init`, `board` | everything above, wired |
| `tui` | the terminal UI (`canon/tui.md`): the view model (blocks from the loop's events), the Bubble Tea program, the choice block the gate and the `ask` tool answer through | the one siphon that never narrows — the human's |
| `cmd/isekai` · `cmd/agent-one` | the two distributions: one `main` each, differing only by the name they hand `app.Main` (lexicon, world dir, env prefix, law file follow) | — |

## Bash — the model's shell, the world's rules

- **Anthropic-defined tools on Anthropic models.** With an `anthropic` provider the binary declares
  Claude's own trained tools — `{"type":"bash_20250124","name":"bash"}` and
  `{"type":"text_editor_20250728","name":"str_replace_based_edit_tool"}` — schema-less, so the model
  drives the shell and editor it was trained on. With an `openai` provider (OpenRouter, Ollama,
  vLLM) the same executors sit behind custom-schema `bash` / `edit` tools. The model chooses the
  words; the binary always executes.
- **One persistent session per body.** The shell keeps its cwd and exported variables between
  calls; `{"restart": true}` resets it. A Court Body gets its own session and loses it with its task.
- **Sandboxed by default.** Each command runs under `bwrap`: the filesystem is read-only except the
  world root and a private `/tmp`, no network unless the command passed the human gate as
  `outward`. No `bwrap` on the machine → `sandbox: none`, reported as `@?` in `status`.
- **The whole binary in a container — `--containered`.** The binary re-runs itself under Docker
  (`docker run --rm --init`): the world mounted read-write at its own path, this binary and what a
  session reads from the host mounted read-only (`~/.config/<dist>`, `~/.<dist>`, the Claude and
  OpenCode instruction/skill/command/agent dirs, git's identity — only those that exist), the
  session store `~/.local/share/<dist>` read-write (sessions must save), `$HOME` otherwise an empty
  tmpfs (no `~/.ssh`, no other secrets), the caller's uid, the host network (the model API and the
  board). Keys cross by name (`-e NAME`), never by value: the terminal's variables, the dist's own
  `<PREFIX>*`, every `*_API_KEY` / `*_BASE_URL`. The image is built on first use from the Dockerfile
  embedded in the binary (debian slim + bash, git, ripgrep, python3, jq, make, curl…), tagged by the
  Dockerfile's hash so a changed runtime is rebuilt; `--image <ref>` runs a richer one. Inside,
  `<PREFIX>CONTAINERED=1` makes the flag a no-op, and `status` says `container: docker <image>` in
  place of the sandbox line: the container is the boundary, bwrap does not nest in it.
- **The guard, before everything.** A denylist of the catastrophic and irreversible — disk wipes,
  `rm -rf` of `/`, home or a system dir (by `~`, `$HOME` or the home's own path), force-pushes and
  remote deletions, repository and secret deletion, history purges, secret-store reads, a script
  from the network piped into a shell — refuses a bash command before the policy and the gate: no
  approval runs it. The built-in list (`guard/patterns.txt`) is always on; the machine-wide
  `~/.agents/hooks/dangerous-patterns.txt` and `guard.files` add to it. `guard test` runs the
  corpus (151 commands, from davidondrej/skills, MIT) — every block blocked, every allow allowed —
  and the classifier is held to the same corpus: every command the guard blocks must reach the
  human (outward or destructive) even with the guard off. `guard install` wires the same list into
  Claude Code (a PreToolUse hook) and OpenCode (a plugin), showing the change first — one denylist
  for every agent on the machine. It stops accidents, not a determined agent (`python -c` slips past
  any regex); the sandbox and the gate stay the containment.
- **Classified before it runs.** The classifier settles the class; permission rules and the human
  gate decide; the model's own claim only tightens. `git` is read through its global options
  (`git -C . push`, `git -c k=v push`, `git --no-pager push` are the verb's class). A path is
  read for where it points: a symlink out of the world, and a file yet to be created under
  one, are outward for `read`, `write`, `edit` and `patch` alike; the editor refuses them.
- **Secrets never cross.** The command's environment drops `*_API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`,
  `*_PASSWORD` and every provider's `apiKeyEnv`; config holds an allow-list.
- **Nothing outlives its call unannounced.** Each command runs in its own process group; a timeout
  kills the group. `background: true` starts a named, logged background job with its own output
  file; jobs are listed in `status` and killed when the session ends.

## The default toolset — everything on, config takes away

The binary ships the tools a daily-driver harness needs, all enabled by default (profile `max`);
config disables, never has to discover:

| Tool | Class | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `bash` | classified per command | persistent sandboxed shell; `background` jobs |
| `read` · `ls` · `glob` · `grep` | read | files, directories, patterns, content search |
| `write` · `edit` · `multiedit` · `patch` | write | create, `str_replace`, several replaces atomically, apply a unified diff |
| `git` | classified per subcommand | `status`/`diff`/`log`/`show` read; `commit` write; `push` outward; `reset --hard` destructive |
| `webfetch` · `websearch` | outward | fetch a URL as text; search via a configured backend |
| `ask` | read | ask the human a question with options, answer returned to the model |
| `dispatch` | per rank | a Court Body (§Ranks and bodies) |
| `recall` · `remember` | read · write | the memory tiers |
| `toolbox` | read | search the registry, load a skill/command/tool body (level 2) |
| `onto` | read | query the creature graph: who owns a path, what a creature may see |
| `skill` | read | don a Mind by name |
| MCP tools | declared by server, classified like any other | every configured MCP server |

Custom tools from config (`tools.custom`) join the same table on the same terms.

## MCP

The binary is an MCP client (JSON-RPC 2.0, stdlib): **stdio** and **streamable HTTP** transports;
OAuth for remote servers comes later — until then a remote server authenticates by header from
an env var.
- **Servers** come from `mcp.servers` in config, and — each behind its own `mcp.import` switch —
  from Claude Code's `.mcp.json` and OpenCode's `opencode.json(c)` `mcp` block, read as-is.
- **Tools** are named `mcp__<server>__<tool>` and enter the toolbox registry as level-1 entries:
  the model sees names and one-line descriptions under the budget, never fifty full schemas; a
  schema is sent to the model once the toolbox picks it for the turn.
- **Classes.** A server is `outward` unless config marks it `inward` (Nature 7 — it is a mouth
  outside the world). Within that, MCP tool annotations only tighten: `destructiveHint` →
  destructive, `openWorldHint` → outward; `readOnlyHint` lowers nothing on its own — only config
  may (`mcp.servers.<s>.tools.<t>.class`). Every call passes the same permission rules and gate.
- **Containment.** A stdio server runs under the same sandbox and env scrubbing as `bash`, with
  its own `env` / `envAllow` and a `network: true|false`; a server that fails to start or dies is
  a `@?` in `status`, and its tools report the fault instead of vanishing.
- **Resources and prompts.** Resources are readable through the `read` tool as
  `mcp://<server>/<uri>`; prompts become slash commands `/<server>:<prompt>`.

## When a tool is missing

The model never meets a silent failure, and never loops on one:
1. **Unknown or disabled tool called** → one error result naming why (`disabled by
   tools.webfetch.enabled in .isekai/config.yaml:12` or `no such tool`) and the closest enabled
   alternatives. The same missing call twice in a turn stops the turn (doom-loop guard).
2. **A capability the body doesn't hold** → `toolbox` search first: the registry covers disabled
   tools, MCP servers, skills and commands too, so the model learns what exists, what is off, and
   what loading it costs.
3. **Composable from what is on** → it is composed (e.g. `ls` via `bash` when `ls` is off), under
   the same classification and gate — a disabled tool is never re-enabled by the back door: a
   `bash` call that reproduces a disabled *outward* tool is still outward and still asks.
4. **Not composable** → the need is named: a `@?` hole to the dispatcher, one hop (Absolute Rule
   III), and a shared note of kind `colony` recording the missing capability.
5. **Named twice** (Nature 4 — Genesis) → the binary proposes the tool: a drafted `tools.custom`
   entry or an `enabled: true` patch, shown to the human as a config diff. Config is the human's
   written word, so it lands only on their yes; then it reloads live.

## Open models

Open-weight models (served by vLLM, Ollama, SGLang, OpenRouter) differ from Claude in four ways
the binary adapts to, per provider in config:
- **Tool shape.** A `minimal` tool profile: few tools, flat schemas, short descriptions. Editing is
  the `str_replace` family (`view` / `create` / `str_replace` / `insert`) as a custom tool — the
  shape most open coding models met in training through SWE-agent/OpenHands-style scaffolds.
- **Tool-call transport.** `toolCalls: native` uses the server's function calling (on vLLM it
  needs `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and the model's `--tool-call-parser`); `toolCalls: text`
  asks for calls as tagged text and parses them in the binary, for servers or models whose native
  calling is broken. A malformed call gets one error result naming the fault, never a guess.
- **Wire by grammar.** Where the server supports guided decoding (`response_format` with a JSON
  schema), a Court Body's report is constrained to the envelope's schema and rendered to the wire
  by the binary — a small model cannot drop `@S` or `@U`. Elsewhere the wire is parsed and a
  malformed report is re-asked once.
- **The real window.** `contextWindow: auto` reads the served maximum (vLLM's `/v1/models`
  `max_model_len`); budgets, the stress zone and the drain trigger scale to it, so a 32k model
  drains early instead of overflowing.

## Models per office, rank and task

The throne never chooses its horse: the session (Rimuru) runs on the model the human picked
(`models.default`, or `--model`). Every other call is routed by what the task demands
(`canon/model-assignments.md`):
- **The triad is chosen by the ask.** The wire already names the office: `@ASK findings` is
  Great Sage's (perceive), `@ASK verdict` Raphael's (judge), `@ASK draft` Ciel's (speak). A
  `dispatch` runs on `models.offices.<office>`; the binary's own calls are routed the same way —
  the end-of-turn gate verdict to Raphael, log entries and the drain's desk to Ciel, recall
  summaries to Great Sage.
- **Resolution, most specific first:** creature (`models.creatures.<name>`) → office → rank
  (`models.ranks.<race>`) → task (`models.tasks.<drain|gate|log|bench>`) → `models.default`. Each
  entry is `provider/model` with optional `effort` and `fallback`. `status` shows the resolved
  model for every office and rank, with the origin of each.
- **The lineage holds.** Great Sage → Raphael → Ciel is one escalating chain: Ciel's model must
  never sit below Raphael's, nor Raphael's below Great Sage's. Providers declare a `tier` per
  model; config that breaks the order is refused at load, and a model with no declared tier is a
  `@?`, never a guess.
- **A script beats a model.** Anything deterministic (journal lines, verdict records, pointer
  tables) is code, and never reaches any office.

## Ranks and bodies, native

- The session is **Rimuru**. A creature is a record read from its doc under
  `.isekai/<race>/<name>/`: race, territory (path globs), traits, worn minds, orc (for a slime).
- A **Court Body** is `dispatch`: a fresh loop with its own context, a commission in the wire
  (`@ROOT @SCOPE @ASK @CAP`), a tool set cut to its rank and territory, its own shell, and one
  wire report back. Its context dies with the call; only what it wrote to disk and its report
  survive. A Court's writes are gated by the Court itself — the end-of-turn gate runs on its
  own account and its verdict is recorded under its own name; nothing propagates upward for a
  second gate. A report with no `@U` line is flagged to the dispatcher (the unsaid). The
  `@U` lines of a background Court are landed by the dispatcher when the report wakes it.
- **Ranks are data, the law's table is the default.** The binary carries the ranks of
  `isekai.md` §The world (Elf, Orc, Slime; Kijin; High Elf, High Orc, Dark Elf) as its built-in
  table: parent, job, whether the rank authors, whether it holds a gate, body mode, default office,
  tools, model. Config (`ranks.<name>`) overrides a field of a built-in rank or adds a new rank; with
  `rankSet: replace` the ranks listed in config are the whole hierarchy and the built-in table is
  not loaded (the default, `extend`, merges over it).
  The law's shape is checked at load and a config that breaks it is refused: the hierarchy is a
  tree rooted at Rimuru; a rank that authors has a gate-holding rank above it (Law 3); a path has
  exactly one gate holder; every rank has an escalation parent (Absolute Rule III); ascended ranks
  keep everything their base rank held. A rank from config becomes an ontology class with its
  bonds, so knowledge flows along it. `status` lists every rank that differs from the law.
- **Territory is enforced.** A Slime's `write`/`edit` outside its territory is refused, not
  warned (Law 2). Escalation is a `@?` to its dispatcher, one hop (Absolute Rule III).

## Live session — talk while the court works

- **Two faces, one engine.** On a terminal the session is the TUI (`canon/tui.md`); on a pipe,
  under `TERM=dumb`, or with `--plain`, it is the line REPL. Both run the same engine, sessions,
  Courts and gate.
- **The human is never locked out.** A turn runs in the background. A line typed mid-turn is
  queued and delivered to the running body at its next tool step (the way Claude Code does);
  `esc` (TUI) or `Ctrl-C` interrupts the turn, a second `Ctrl-C` exits.
- **A stopped turn is not a dead session.** When a turn ends on its tool results (denied,
  escalated, checkpointed), the next ask rides that user message rather than following it — two
  user messages in a row is a shape no provider takes.
- **Courts run in the background.** `dispatch` may be asynchronous: the dispatcher keeps working
  and is woken by the Court's report. A running Court stays addressable (`/send <court> <text>`)
  until its dispatcher accepts the report; then its context dies (§Minds & Bodies — the task is
  over when the report is taken).
- **The court is visible.** `/agents` (and a status line above the prompt) shows every live body:
  rank, office, model, state (thinking · tool · waiting on gate · done), elapsed, context
  occupancy against its window, tokens and cost so far. Starts and reports are announced between
  prompts, one line each (the TUI draws each Court as a block with its report rendered).
- **Consumption is an instrument** (Nature 9). Every provider call's usage (input, output, cache
  read, cache write) is journaled to `.isekai/instruments/usage/<session>.jsonl`, priced from the
  provider's per-model `price` in config (unpriced models show tokens, never a guessed cost), and
  rolled up per body, office, rank, model and session. `/usage` and `isekai usage [--session
  <id>|--since <date>]` read it; `tempest.js` can read the same file. The session's own calls
  carry no office — the throne is not an office; an office labels a dispatched Court and the
  binary's own routed calls (verdict → raphael, drain and log → ciel, recall → great-sage).
- **Budgets are readings too.** `budgets.session.tokens|usd` and `budgets.court.tokens|usd` stop a
  body honestly at the line (checkpoint, report, resume command), never mid-write.

## The gate and Vitality, in code

At the end of any turn that wrote files, before the turn is reported done:
1. **Right slime authored** — every written path maps to the territory of the body that wrote it.
2. **Traits hold** — each touched creature's `verify` commands (from its doc) run; exit codes are
   the reading. The lines that run are the ones the doc held *before* the turn, plus any it added:
   Vitality makes a body edit its own doc in the same turn, so the post-turn lines alone would let
   it rewrite the check it is judged by. A pre-turn line the turn removed or changed still runs, and
   the change is a hole for the gate holder to confirm.
- **Tests intact** (`law.gate.testsIntact`) — a turn may not pass by making the tests easier. The
   loop keeps the test files' text as the turn opens (Go, JS/TS, Python; bounded); a touched test
   file that lost tests, gained a skip or an `.only`, or was deleted fails the gate. Only the human
   decides a test goes.
- **UI system** (`law.gate.ui`) — a turn that wrote under the app's ui dir (`ui/`, `src/ui/`, …)
   regenerates the legend (`<world>/ui-assets/`, derived, never the model's to write) and must pass
   `ui check`'s lints: no literal colour or pixel length outside tokens.css and palettes.css, every
   class the html uses declared, every token read defined, every component header true. The
   screenshots are not taken at the gate; the Mind has the agent take and read them.
3. **Duties done** — the commission's `@ASK` is answered (`@S` present, holes named as `@?`).
4. **Doc truthful** — a change under a territory with no change to its owning doc fails
   (Nature 1). The owning doc is the Slime's doc, else the Orc's.

The verdict (pass / fail + reason) is appended to `log.md` by the binary. A world with no orcs
records `Gate: n/a (no orcs)` and still runs check 4 against any doc it can find.

**A fail goes back once.** A failed verdict is first sent back to the model, its reasons as the next
message, and the same turn continues — the whole turn's writes are gated again — up to
`law.gate.retries` times (default 1; 0 fails at once). Every attempt's verdict is in `log.md`, and
the answer carries a hole naming each send-back; past the retries the turn fails.

**Every write is seen, whatever tool made it.** A tool that knows its paths reports them
(`write`, `edit`, `patch`); the shell, a custom tool and an MCP server do not. So the engine
stamps the world tree — size and mtime per file, `.git` never walked, bounded at 200k files — at
the start of a turn, again after every write-class step (the difference is that step's writes
when it named none), and once more at the turn's end (a write a read-classified command slipped
in, `xargs touch`). The world dir's own instruments and records are not the model's writes and
are not stamped: `instruments/`, `tmp/`, `memory/`, `toolbox/registry.json`,
`ontology/graph/unsaid.ttl`, `log.md`. A tree past the cap is not watched and the hole is named
in the report. A turn's writes are gated once; the next turn of the same session gates only its
own. The `dispatch` step names what its Court wrote, and the dispatcher's gate leaves those paths
alone — one verdict per landing, the Court's. A background Court still writing when its
dispatcher's turn ends is the one case the dispatcher's gate may see a Court's write.

## The ontology

Knowledge passes between creatures along a typed graph of their relations. The graph is
formal (so it can be checked) and projected to terse text (so a model reads it cheaply).

- **Schema** — `.isekai/ontology/schema.ttl`, a Turtle subset: classes (`Creature` ⊃ `Rimuru`,
  `Elf`, `Orc`, `Slime`, `Kijin`; `Mind`; `Doc`; `Fact` ⊃ `Law`, `Colony`, `Territory`), properties
  with domain, range, `subPropertyOf`, `inverseOf`, transitivity, and cardinality shapes. The
  bonds are the world's own: `truth` (slime ⇒ orc), `verdict` (orc ⇒ elf), `wears` (body ⇌ mind),
  `owns` (creature → path), `knows` (creature → fact), `about` (fact → creature | path).
- **Graph** — asserted triples in `.isekai/ontology/graph/*.ttl`, plus triples *derived* at load
  from the world itself (creatures, territories, worn minds, orcs). Derived triples are never
  written back; files are truth.
- **Reasoning** — forward-chaining to a fixpoint over RDFS-style rules (subclass, subproperty,
  domain/range typing, inverse, transitive). Small, total, deterministic.
- **Validation** — shapes: every Slime has exactly one `truth` edge; every Mind is worn, or is
  shared (a host skill with no race prefix); no two Slimes own an overlapping path (Nature 2). A violation is a finding.
- **Flow** — analysis flows up: a `Fact` a Slime `knows` is visible to every creature up its
  `truth`/`verdict` chain. Wisdom flows down: a `Law` known above is visible below. A Court's `@U`
  lines become asserted `Fact`s, typed by their kind, attached to the reporting body.
- **Projection** — `isekai onto project <creature> --budget N` walks what that creature may see
  and emits one plain line per fact, nearest first, under the budget:
  `slime-auth ⇒truth orc-security · token TTL is 15m (territory)`. This is what a dispatched Court
  receives; the Turtle never enters a prompt (Tokens, not eyes — no IRIs, no prefixes).

## Compaction — drain, don't summarize

A generic harness compacts by asking the model to summarize the whole conversation into one blob:
lossy, blind to what is already on disk, and the unsaid dies with the context. Here the memory
tiers already say where every kind of knowledge lives, so compaction is a **drain**: each piece of
context moves to its home, and the new context is rebuilt from those homes by pointer.

**Trigger — a reading, never an overflow.** The context instrument crosses the configured
threshold (default: the 180k stress zone of the 200k budget, or a fraction of the model's real
window, whichever is lower). Never on a provider "context too long" error — by then it is too late
to drain honestly.

**The drain, in order** — mechanical passes first, the model only where judgment is needed:
1. **Point, don't carry** (no model). Every tool result that is a file read, grep or glob is
   replaced by a pointer: `path:line-range · sha256-prefix`. A file already on disk is never kept
   twice. Duplicate reads collapse to the latest.
2. **Trim the spent** (no model). Tool outputs of finished steps shrink to their journal line
   (exit code, verdict, tail) — the full output is already in `.isekai/instruments/loop/`.
3. **Surface the unsaid** (model, one call). The model is commissioned `@ASK findings +unsaid`
   over the turns being drained and answers in the wire. Each `@U law|colony|territory` goes home:
   a shared note (`memory remember --kind`), an ontology Fact attached to the current creature, and
   for territory a proposed edit to the Slime's doc (gated like any write). `@F` lines worth
   keeping land as shared notes.
4. **Write the desk** (same call). The working memory — at most ~5 dated thoughts: the goal, the
   plan's position, decisions taken and why, open holes (`@?`), the next step. This is the
   hippocampal buffer, not a summary of history.
5. **Record the episode** (no model). If the drained turns landed changes, their `log.md` entry is
   appended now, not at the end of the session.

**The rebuilt context**, in order: the crest · the commission (the human's ask, verbatim) · the
desk · the ontology projection for the current creature · the recall manifest for the current ask
(memory hits + toolbox `@T` lines, pointers only) · the pointer table · the last N turns verbatim.

**Nothing is lost that can be recalled.** The drained turns are indexed into the short tier's
semantic cache for this session; `recall` can bring any of them back on demand, and any pointer
can be re-read. A pointer whose file changed since (digest mismatch) is flagged, not trusted
(Nature 9).

**Verify the drain.** After rebuilding, the binary checks: the ask is present verbatim; every `@?`
open before is still present; every pointer resolves; tokens after < tokens before. A failed check
aborts the compaction and keeps the old context. Every drain is journaled with before/after tokens,
pointers made, notes and facts landed.

**Dispatch first, drain second.** In the stress zone the cheapest compaction is not to accumulate:
heavy work goes to a Court Body whose context dies with its task (§Minds & Bodies). Compaction is
for what dispatch could not avoid.

Every pass is switchable in config (`compaction.passes.*`); a `summary` strategy exists as the
generic fallback, and `status` shows which strategy and passes are live.

## Handoff — what a fresh session needs

`/handoff [focus]` (or `<dist> handoff [focus]`) is a turn: the binary gathers what it knows — the
session's first ask, the uncommitted changes, the recent commits, the last log.md entries, the previous
handoff to carry forward — and the model writes `<world>/handoffs/<time>.md` from a fixed template:
goal, why, state (done · partial · not started — state, not orders), decisions and why, traps and dead
ends, pointers (by path, never copied), open work. Secrets by location only. The next session's welcome
names a handoff under two weeks old; `/handoff read [path]` hands it to the model with one rule: read
every listed file, trust no claim unverified, then wait for the human. The context stress zone points
at it. (After davidondrej/skills' handoff, MIT.)

## Goals — work until a command proves it

`<dist> goal --validate "<cmd>" [--read <files>] [--constraints <text>] [--max-turns N] "<objective>"`
runs one session to a contract: objective, what to read first, what must not change, the validation,
the stop condition. The binary runs the validation itself after every turn (bash in the world root,
15 min) — the model can neither skip nor edit it — and hands a failure back as the next turn's ask with
the exit code and the output's tail. It stops when the validation passes (exit 0), when the model ends
an answer with `@? human: <what it needs>` (exit 3), at the turn ceiling (default 12, exit 1), or when a
turn fails or checkpoints. The contract forbids weakening tests; the gate's tests-intact enforces it on
every turn. (After davidondrej/skills' goal-loop, MIT.)

## Review — two reviewers, one shortlist

`/review [range]` (or `<dist> review [range]`) runs two independent reviewers in parallel, on two
offices' models (raphael and ciel: two models when config gives them two), each with the same neutral
brief — read the diff, the changed code in full, the code around it and its tests; report serious or
critical issues with file:line, why and the fix; separate verified from suspected; say whether it is
ready to merge. The range is the argument, else the uncommitted changes, else the last commit. A
reviewer's shelf is read-only: anything above a read is refused, never asked. A reviewer that does not
finish fails the review — a partial review is not a review. Both reports go to the session, which
merges them: deduplicated, judged (agreement alone does not make an issue real), a numbered shortlist
marked [both] / [raphael] / [ciel] with the ones both found first, the count dropped as overthinking,
and a request for the human's approval — nothing is fixed before it. In a session the reviewers run in
the background and the merge arrives as a turn. A world's own `/review` command wins over the built-in one. (After davidondrej/skills' total-review, MIT.)

## The first run — a setup form

`init --level` founds the world at one of three depths (a terminal asks which when no level is named):
**light** (or soft) writes the law, the log, the instruments and the memory tiers — creatures come
later; **medium** also sketches a colony from the file tree with no model — an elf, an orc per
source area (thin areas merged into a core orc), a slime per sub-area, a kijin when there is CI,
and verify lines for the language (a Go dir starting with `_` is tested by explicit path, since
`./...` skips it) — never overwriting a doc; **complex** runs a founding session: the model reads
every source file and decides the team the code needs — how many elves, orcs, slimes, a kijin,
which minds (zone, verdict, global) and which bodies (court, keeper) — writes the docs, skills and
agents in the shapes the ontology reads, keeps only verify lines that pass now, and runs
`onto check` until it is clean; the medium sketch is its first hint (`app/found.md` is the brief).
The founding turn writes every creature's doc as the session, so its gate lifts "right author" for
that turn only; every other check holds.

`init` founds the world; on a terminal it then asks, in a Huh form, which model the world runs on —
keep the global config, OpenRouter's free models, Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible
server — and writes the world's `config.yaml` (the key's *name* only; the key never lands in a file),
saying so when that variable is not set in the shell. A pipe, `--plain`, a world that already has a
config, or `<PREFIX>NO_SETUP` skips it.

## The board — the world, seen

`isekai` lights the board when it starts (`ui.board.autostart`, default on; `isekai board` alone
serves it without a session). It is served by the binary itself on `127.0.0.1` (`ui.board.port`),
reads the same instruments the session writes, and updates live over server-sent events. It
supersedes `tempest.js` once it shows everything tempest shows.
- **Pages, not one scroll:** Overview · Court (live bodies, states, context, cost) · Usage (tokens
  and cost by body, office, rank, model, day) · Colony (the creature graph from the ontology) ·
  Memory (tiers, notes, unsaid by kind) · Toolbox (registry, what was offered vs loaded) · Log ·
  Config (effective config with origins, the off-list).
- **The grid is Bootstrap's.** Bootstrap 5 CSS is embedded in the binary — the 12-column grid,
  its breakpoints (`sm` 576 · `md` 768 · `lg` 992 · `xl` 1200 · `xxl` 1400), utilities and
  components — so every page is responsive from a phone to a wide screen, offline. Isekai's own
  look is a thin theme over it (colour tokens for each rank and lane, dark and light), never a
  second layout system. Charts and the colony graph are inline SVG sized by their grid column.

**The dashboard — `/dash`, and `dash`.** Beside the board pages the same server serves a
dashboard built on the world's own ui system (`board/web/`: tokens, palettes, layout primitives,
components — held to `ui check` by a test): the session's console (the transcript read like a page,
tool calls, Courts and verdicts as folded cards, approvals and questions as choice cards, one input:
Enter sends, ↑ recalls, Esc interrupts, `/` runs a command), the world as a neural net (layers from
input to crown, bonds as synapses, live bodies glow and their synapses carry a pulse, a click lights
a node's neighbourhood and opens its knowledge card), metrics (tokens, cost, calls, context, cache;
by day, model and body) and relations (the bond matrix and its dimensions: by rank, lane and bond).
With the terminal open the dashboard mirrors the session and can ask into it; approvals stay in the
terminal. `<dist> dash [--open]` runs the session headless with the dashboard as its only ui, and
approvals are answered in the browser. The board listens on 127.0.0.1 only (with `--containered`
the container shares the host network, so it is still the host's loopback); every act (ask,
answer, interrupt) carries a per-run token the page embeds and must name a loopback Host with a
same-origin Origin, so another site cannot drive the session and a rebound DNS name cannot reach
it. The page's CSP allows only its own scripts.

The command's own output — the board, each session — is a Charm Log: levelled, coloured, timed.

## Tests

Every package carries Go tests; providers are exercised through `mock`. `isekai selftest` runs
the in-binary checks the way the JS instruments' `selftest` does and answers on the wire
(`@S PASS n checks`). Interop tests run the binary and the JS tools against the same files.
