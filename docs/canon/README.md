# Canon transcriptions

The files in this folder are faithful transcriptions from photographs of a fuller `ISEKAI.md`
canon than the version currently installed by the `/isekai` command (`.isekai/isekai.md`,
`.claude/commands/isekai.md`, `.opencode/commands/isekai.md`). The installed skill template
only carries the Crest, the Nine Natures, Principles, the wire-language rules, Instruments,
Minds & Bodies, the world table, the gate, and six Laws.

The photographed source has more structure than that: the same Nine Natures, but underneath
them a numbered rule set (1–21, grouped into Chapters I–VII) and a separate E1–E6 protocol
set for Minds & Bodies specifically. Rimuru's own throne-body instructions describe the full
canon chain as **Nature laws 0–8 → rules 1–21 → E-protocols → colony map** — all three layers
live together in one `ISEKAI.md`, not as separate documents. The source also documents the
`/isekai` command's own logic in more detail than what's installed (two phases — audit-only
vs. populate — plus an `AGENTS.md` template it appends).

These files were transcribed rather than merged into `.isekai/isekai.md` / the installed
`/isekai` command directly, because reconciling two differently-structured numbering schemes
(Laws 1–6 vs. rules 1–21), and adding the Phase 2a/2b + `AGENTS.md` + `tools/tempest.js`
logic the installed command doesn't have, without guessing at the parts the photos didn't
capture, risked introducing contradictions into the live convention. Treat this folder as raw
source material for a future, more complete `ISEKAI.md` and `/isekai` command — not yet
operative. One piece of it *has* been built already: `tempest.js` itself
(`.isekai/tools/tempest.js`), implemented from `instruments-tempest.md` since that spec was
unambiguous enough to build directly.

## What's here

- [`rules-chapters.md`](rules-chapters.md) — the E1–E6 protocols and Chapters I–VII (rules 1–21)
- [`ascended-races.md`](ascended-races.md) — fuller prose on high orc and dark elf
- [`rimuru-throne-body.md`](rimuru-throne-body.md) — the OpenCode-side global "throne body" agent spec
- [`isekai-phases.md`](isekai-phases.md) — the `/isekai` command's real Phase 2a (audit-only)
  and Phase 2b (populate) logic — richer than what's installed
- [`templates.md`](templates.md) — the `AGENTS.md` colony-block template Phase 2b appends
- [`instruments-tempest.md`](instruments-tempest.md) — the full `tempest.js` instrument-board
  spec — **implemented** at [`../tools/tempest.js`](../tools/tempest.js)
- [`memory-tiers.md`](memory-tiers.md) — the three memories every creature has (short · long ·
  shared), the files-are-truth boundary, relation-ranked recall, and the path to a DB tier —
  **implemented** at [`../tools/memory.js`](../tools/memory.js)
- [`agent-loop.md`](agent-loop.md) — the six-beat loop every Court Body runs (perceive → recall →
  plan → act → verify → record): budgets as readings, four step classes with the human gate,
  journaled resume, one-hop escalation — **implemented** at [`../tools/loop.js`](../tools/loop.js)
- [`toolbox.md`](toolbox.md) — the two-level toolbox: a priced registry of Minds, commands, tools,
  Bodies and externals; level 1 injects only the manifest that fits the turn and the budget, level 2
  loads a body on the creature's own decision — **implemented** at [`../tools/toolbox.js`](../tools/toolbox.js)
- [`binary.md`](binary.md) — the `isekai` Go binary: the law as a harness — native ranks and
  Court dispatch, the gate and Vitality in code, the human gate, the wire, and the ontology that
  passes knowledge along creature relations — **source** at [`../../isekai/`](../../isekai/)
- [`harness-parity.md`](harness-parity.md) — what Claude Code and OpenCode ship, what the binary
  ships in v0, what it defers, what it refuses, and how each capability meets the law
- [`config.md`](config.md) — the binary's config: locations, precedence, the full schema with every
  feature switchable, per-distribution defaults, and the rule that a switched-off law is a finding
- [`tui.md`](tui.md) — the terminal UI, Claude Code style: inline scrollback, streamed markdown,
  tool blocks with diffs, inline approvals, the slash menu, the spinner and footer
- [`ui.md`](ui.md) — how the world draws its pages: the Bootstrap 5 grid, mobile first,
  components before custom markup, an isekai theme over Bootstrap's tokens, SVG sized by column
- [`runtime.md`](runtime.md) — the v0.2 design: the container runtime (permissions follow what is at
  risk), enterprise registries, secrets in two steps, the corporate proxy, worlds and dimensions
- [`agents/great-sage.md`](agents/great-sage.md), [`agents/raphael.md`](agents/raphael.md),
  [`agents/ciel.md`](agents/ciel.md) — templates for all three "court triad" bodies
  (perceive / judge / speak); `ciel.md` is complete, the other two have small gaps (see below)

## Known gaps

The source photos cut off before capturing:
- The full text of rules 12–13 (Chapter V — Tracking) — only the tail of 13 survived.
- The Kijin paragraph in the ascended-races section (High orc and Dark elf are complete; Kijin
  is not).
- Rules 1–3 of Raphael's own office laws (only 4–6 and its Wire mouth section survived).
- Great Sage's own Wire mouth commissions (only its office laws survived).
- The `.opencode/skills/` seed template that Phase 2b step 3 refers to ("seed template
  below") was never itself photographed — only the reference to it.

Complete: `ciel.md` (all three court-triad members now transcribed in full), and Phase 2a +
Phase 2b of the `/isekai` command (both phases and the `AGENTS.md` template captured in full).

Don't fill these gaps by inference — if you find the rest of this source, transcribe it
directly; otherwise leave the gap marked.
