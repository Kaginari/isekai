[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-26

### Highlights

Works with Google Gemini's OpenAI-compatible API, free tier included: each tool call's `thought_signature` travels back on the next turn (multi-step tool use failed before), 429 and 5xx answers are retried with backoff (honouring `Retry-After`), and Gemini's array-form errors are shown instead of "unreadable body". The session answers you in plain language; only dispatched Court Bodies answer on the wire.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-26

### Highlights

`run "<ask>"` no longer reads stdin — an inherited pipe that never closes (CI, another agent, cron) could hang it; stdin is read only for `run` with no ask or `run -`. Background jobs killed by a timeout no longer print a stray "Killed" line into the next command's output.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-26

### Highlights

The board's off-list now names switched-off tools (it said "everything on" while a tool was off), and long origins wrap inside their card.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-26

### Highlights

A patch release for two defects found by running the released binary in a plain world.

### Fixed
- A machine-wide agent file named after the throne (e.g. OpenCode's `~/.config/opencode/agents/rimuru.md`) was imported as a creature with rank `elf`, so the session ran with the elf's office, model route and tool shelf. The session's name is now reserved.
- The toolbox's level-2 hint named `node .isekai/tools/toolbox.js`, which releases do not ship; it names `isekai toolbox` unless the world ships the JS instrument.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-26

### Highlights

A patch release: the default model is `anthropic/claude-opus-5` (0.1.0 shipped an outdated default),
and the live REPL no longer races the session's context reading while a turn perceives it.

### Fixed
- Default model `anthropic/claude-opus-5`.
- A data race between the status line / board and the running turn's context reading.
- The shared Harbor smoke task uses neutral wording.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-26

### Highlights

First release: the isekai convention as a Go binary. The law is enforced by the harness — the end-of-turn gate with its verdict in `log.md`, the human gate with per-command permission rules, a `bwrap`-sandboxed persistent shell, and native memory with compaction by drain. Ranks and Court dispatch are native, each office can run its own model, and every feature is switchable in YAML or JSON with switched-off law always reported. Ships the board (eight responsive pages), MCP (stdio and HTTP), Claude Code / OpenCode compatibility for instructions, skills, commands and agents, and a Harbor benchmark adapter.
